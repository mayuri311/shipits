# AI Summary Feature - Setup Instructions

## üöÄ Quick Setup

The AI summary feature is now **fully implemented and fixed**! To get it working, you just need to add your Azure OpenAI credentials.

### 1. Get Azure OpenAI Credentials

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Create or find your Azure OpenAI resource
3. Go to "Keys and Endpoint"
4. Copy your endpoint and API key

### 2. Add Credentials to Environment

**For Development:**
Edit your `.env` file and replace the placeholder values:

```bash
# Azure OpenAI Configuration for AI Summaries
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-actual-resource-name.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o
```

**For Production:**
Set these environment variables in your deployment platform:
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`

### 3. Deploy a Model (if not done already)

1. Go to Azure OpenAI Studio
2. Navigate to "Deployments"
3. Create a deployment with model `gpt-4o` (recommended)
4. Use the deployment name as your `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`

## üéØ How It Works

Once configured, users will see:

1. **Thread Summary Button**: On project detail pages with comments
2. **Generate Summary**: Click to create AI-powered summaries
3. **Smart Caching**: Summaries are cached and only regenerate when needed
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if Azure OpenAI is unavailable

## üîß Fixes Applied

‚úÖ **Fixed import issues** with dynamic module loading  
‚úÖ **Added proper error handling** for missing credentials  
‚úÖ **Fixed duplicate UI elements** in project detail page  
‚úÖ **Added environment variable templates**  
‚úÖ **Improved initialization** to not crash app if Azure OpenAI is unavailable  
‚úÖ **Enhanced logging** for debugging

## üß™ Testing

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to any project with comments
3. Look for the "‚ú® AI Summary" button
4. Click to generate a summary

The app will work fine even without Azure OpenAI configured - the AI features will just be disabled with appropriate user feedback.

## üìù Notes

- Summaries are cached for 24 hours or until 3+ new comments are added
- The system uses the `gpt-4o` model by default (fast and cost-effective)
- All Azure OpenAI requests are logged for debugging
- The feature gracefully degrades if not configured
